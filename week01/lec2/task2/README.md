## How to launch it

```
git clone https://github.com/Yevs/kottans-homework.git
cd kottans-homework/week01/lec2/task2
npm i
nodejs byebyebootstrap.js <path to your file.html> <optional path to your output file>
```

Default output file name is `out.html`.

There is an `index.html` file as example if you just want to see how it works.
