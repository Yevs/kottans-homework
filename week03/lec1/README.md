## Deep assign module

## How to run it

```
git clone https://github.com/Yevs/kottans-homework.git
cd kottans-homework/week03/lec1
nodejs index.js
```

Solution is located in `deepAssign.js` file while `index.js` is just an example of how it works.

Both deep assign with override & without override are implemented in `deepAssignOverride.js` and `deepAssignNoOverride.js` respectively. There are examples to see differences in `index.js`.
